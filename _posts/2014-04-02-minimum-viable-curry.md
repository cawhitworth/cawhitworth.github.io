title: Minimum Viable Curry
---
It looks intimidating, but seriously, it takes, like, 15 minutes to prep and
then you just leave it to simmer for ages and it's tasty as.

## You will need:

### Spices:

 * 2 tsp   Ground coriander
 * 2 tsp   Ground cumin
 * 1 tsp   Paprika
 * 1/2 tsp Turmeric
 * 2 tsp   Madras Curry Powder
 * 1/2 tsp Garam Masala
 * 1 tsp   Salt

> (don't buy these from a supermarket; go to a world foods grocery and
> buy them in useful sized bags. You may as well buy some fennel seeds,
> cardamom pods, cloves and whatever other spices you fancy whilst you're
> there. They'll keep for a good few months and you'll get through them if you
> make a curry more than once a year)

### Other ingredients:

 * 1       Medium onion, finely diced. You're looking for 2-3mm sized bits.
 * 3-4     Cloves of garlic, crushed
 * 1       Tin of chopped tomatoes
 *         Vegetable oil

## What to do

Put a decent slug of vegetable oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. What
qualifies as a decent slug basically depends on how greasy you like your
curry and how much of a health kick you're on. You at least want to cover the
bottom of a medium saucepan. Use more and/or add some butter if you want
something less healthy.

Soften the onion and garlic until they go translucent. This'll take about
five minutes over a medium heat, assuming you've chopped things finely. You
might like to soften the onion first and then add the garlic after a minute or
two; garlic tends to burn quickly if you're not careful.

Now, add all the spices and stir into a paste. If it doesn't form a paste,
you've not got enough oil. Add a bit more (or some water, if you're bothered
about the calories) until it forms a soft clay-like texture.

Turn up the heat and fry the spice and onion mixture for a minute or so,
stirring continuously.

Once your kitchen smells basically amazing, tip in a tin of chopped tomatoes.
Then half-fill the tin with water, swirl a bit then add that too.

Bring to a low boil then reduce to a simmer for however long it takes for it
to turn into a big tasty pot of sauce. Probably 45 minutes to an hour.

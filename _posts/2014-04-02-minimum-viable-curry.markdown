title: Minimum Viable Curry
---
It looks intimidating, but seriously, it takes, like, 15 minutes to prep and
then you just leave it to simmer for ages and it's tasty as.

## You will need:

### Spices:

 * 2 tsp   Ground coriander
 * 2 tsp   Ground cumin
 * 1 tsp   Paprika
 * 1/2 tsp Turmeric
 * 2 tsp   Madras Curry Powder
 * 1/2 tsp Garam Masala
 * 1 tsp   Salt

(don't buy these from a supermarket; go to a world foods grocery and
buy them in useful sized bags. You may as well buy some fennel seeds,
cardamom pods, cloves and whatever other spices you fancy whilst you're
there. They'll keep for a good few months and you'll get through them if you
make a curry more than once a year)

### Other ingredients:

 * 1       Medium onion, finely diced. You're looking for 2-3mm sized bits.
 * 3-4     Cloves of garlic, crushed
 * 1       Tin of chopped tomatoes
 *         Vegetable oil

Plus whatever you want to go in the curry - meat (cooked or raw) and veg
(peppers, okra, chick peas, potatoes, etc).

## What to do

Put a decent slug of vegetable oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. What
qualifies as a decent slug basically depends on how greasy you like your
curry and how much of a health kick you're on. You at least want to cover the
bottom of a medium saucepan. Use more and/or add some butter if you want
something less healthy.

Soften the onion and garlic until they go translucent. This'll take about
five minutes over a medium heat, assuming you've chopped things finely. You
might like to soften the onion first and then add the garlic after a minute or
two; garlic tends to burn quickly if you're not careful.

Now, add all the spices and stir into a paste. If it doesn't form a paste,
you've not got enough oil. Add a bit more (or some water, if you're bothered
about the calories) until it forms a soft clay-like texture.

Turn up the heat and fry the spice and onion mixture for a minute or so,
stirring continuously. If you want to put some bits of meat or chunky veg
(potatoes, peppers, etc) in, now is a good time - fry them with the spices to
get a good coating and seal.

Once your kitchen smells basically amazing, tip in a tin of chopped tomatoes.
Then half-fill the tin with water, swirl a bit then add that too.  Bring to a
low boil then reduce to a simmer for however long it takes for it to turn into
a big tasty pot of sauce; the longer you can leave it the better but
realistically you're looking at 45 minutes or more.

If you've got some pre-cooked meat (leftover chicken or what have you), add
it maybe ten minutes before the end to heat through. This is also when I'd add
chickpeas, if I'm using them.

And that's basically it. Serve with rice or chapattis or whatever you fancy.
Like I say, it looks like a lot of faff but once you've got the spices, it
really is only about 15 minutes work.
